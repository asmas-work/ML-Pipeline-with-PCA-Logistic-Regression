# ML-Pipeline-with-PCA-Logistic-Regression
Built a Python tool that prepares datasets for machine learning and tests how well a logistic regression model performs after reducing the number of features using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). It works with different types of datasets and automatically handles common issues like missing data and unnecessary columns.
